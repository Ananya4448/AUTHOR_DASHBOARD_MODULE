Author module page 

The creation of an author module page for submitting conference papers involves designing a user-friendly interface where authors can easily upload and manage their submissions. This page typically includes features such as form fields for title, abstract, keywords, and file upload, as well as options for selecting relevant topics and co-authors. Authors may also track the status of their submissions and receive notifications. The module streamlines the submission process, enhancing efficiency and ensuring all necessary information is provided for conference organizers.
